    <p><b>Saddam Hussein</b> was the president of <b>Iraq from 1979 to 2003.</b> How people judge him depends a lot on perspective—but 
        here’s the clear, balanced picture:</p>
    <h2>What he was like as a leader</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Authoritarian ruler:</b> He governed with strict control. Political
         opposition was crushed; dissent often meant prison or death.</li>
         <li><b></b>Strongman image:</b> Promoted Iraqi nationalism and kept tight security over the state.</li>
         <li><b>Human rights abuses:</b> Responsible for mass killings, torture, and repression—especially against <b> Kurds </b> and <b>Shia Muslims</b> (e.g., the <b> Anfal campaign).</b></li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Wars & conflicts</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Iran–Iraq War (1980–1988):</b> Extremely deadly; devastated both countries.</li>
        <li><b>Invasion of Kuwait (1990):</b> Led to the Gulf War and years of international sanctions that hurt Iraq’s economy and civilians.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Economy & society</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Early years saw <b> infrastructure and education improvements,</b> funded by oil.</li>
        <li>Later years were marked by <b> sanctions, poverty, and isolation.</b></li>
    </ul>
    <h2>End of his rule</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Overthrown in 2003</b> after the U.S.-led invasion.</li>
        <li>Captured, tried by an Iraqi court, and <b>executed in 2006.</b></li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Bottom line</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>To some Iraqis, he symbolized <b> order and national pride.</b></li>
        <li>To many others—and to most historians—he is remembered as a <b> brutal dictator </b> whose rule caused immense suffering.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>If you want, tell me<b>what angle you’re curious about </b> his personality, his impact on Iraq today, or how different groups remember him—and I’ll go deeper.</p>
